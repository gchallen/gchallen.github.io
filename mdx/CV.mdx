## Appointments and Preparation

I am currently a [Teaching Associate Professor](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/challen) at the [University of Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (Fall 2017–present).
My appointment is 60% teaching and my focus is teaching effectively at scale.

At this particular moment in computing history, what we need is not more computer _power_—we need more computer _people_.
My goal is to create courses that excite, train, and retain these new computer scientists.
I focus on instructional approaches that can scale to large numbers of students using limited human resources.
I apply my own skills as a computer scientist to this task, by building novel tools and systems that create interactive and engaging learning environments.

[My CS1 course](https://cs124.org) currently enrolls over 2000 students per year.
Since I began teaching the course in Fall 2017, enrollment has doubled, drop rates have fallen, success rates have increased, student performance in later courses has improved, a gender performance gap has disappeared, students are practicing and learning more, the amount of content covered has increased, we have [introduced Kotlin as a language option](/essays/2021-11-21-cs1-in-kotlin) alongside Java, and [hundreds of staff members have made contributions](https://www.learncs.online/people) that help diversify the voice with which the course speaks.

### Previous Position

From 2011–2017 I worked in mobile systems as a research professor at the University of Buffalo.
My research group designed, built, and evaluated novel computer systems.
We focused on smartphones, since they represent the most pervasive and powerful distributed system ever deployed.
My [previous group's website](https://www.bluegroup.systems) is the best source of information about my prior research, and includes project descriptions, copies of all of our published papers and funded grant proposals, information about the courses that we created and taught, and details about former group members.

### Professional Preparation

* 2010–2011, Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Supervised by [Hari Balakrishnan](http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~hari/).
* 2010, Ph.D, Computer Science, Harvard University.
Dissertation: ["Data Fidelity and Resource Management for Data-Rich Sensor Networks"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.461.256).
Advised by [Matt Welsh](https://www.mdw.la/).
* 2003, AB, Physics, Harvard University.

## Teaching

Over 12 semesters at Illinois I have taught a total of 8,962 students^[Including two summers terms].
I have focused my efforts on expanding and improving our CS1 course for majors and students with deep interest in the material—previously numbered [CS 125](https://cs125-old.cs.illinois.edu/) and now [CS 124](https://www.cs124.org/).

Additional information about each course is linked off its main website.
Data about student success in each course and detailed student evaluation results available by request.
For more details, please review my [teaching statement](/statements/teaching).

### University at Buffalo (2011–2016)

During my five years at UB I taught a total of 1150 students—an average of 104 per semester—and offered four different courses to beginning undergraduates, advanced undergraduates and graduate students.
Despite being extremely challenging and required for undergraduate computer science majors, my [course on computer operating systems](https://ops-class.org/) was among the most popular in the department and a favorite of both graduate and undergraduate students.
My graduate seminar on rotating topics in mobile systems attracted a small group of motivated students and recruited sev-eral new Ph.D. students into my group, while giving advanced undergraduates the chance to explore research topics.
In Fall 2016 I introduced [a new course on the internet](https://www.bluegroup.systems/courses/ub_199_fall_2016/) to freshman undergraduates.

My [UB online teaching portfolio](https://www.bluegroup.systems/portfolio/) has information about these and other teaching- related activities at UB.
I also have copies of a [teaching statement](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-Teaching.pdf) and statements of [course effectiveness](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-Effectiveness.pdf) and [improvement](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-Improvement.pdf) that I prepared in 2016.

## Curriculum Development

* **2020–:** Led a team of faculty that proposed and passed a significant revision to the core programming sequence at the University of Illinois.
The revision created several new courses and improved the accessibility of the computer science degree program for non-majors.
* **2016–2017:** Led the Curriculum Development Committee which proposed and passed a significant revision to the undergraduate curriculum at the University at Buffalo.
The revision created several new courses and updated several others to overall produce a more relevant and engaging undergraduate degree program.
* **2016:** designed and deployed "CS 199: How the Internet Works", a undergraduate course at the University at Buffalo.

## Service

For more details, please review my [service statement](/statements/service).

* **2022–:** Published a freely-available public version of my CS1 materials at [`learncs.online`](https://learncs.online).
* **2021–2022:** Served as the first teaching faculty chair of the teaching faculty hiring committee. Improved our ad and promotional materials, and made significant changes to the hiring process to improve our ability to identify excellent instructors.
* **2021:** Helped organize the inaugural [Illinois Computer Science Summer Teaching Workshop](https://teaching-workshop.cs.illinois.edu/2021).
* **2011–present:** Service on departmental committees including undergraduate studies, faculty hiring, diversity, curriculum revision, and others.

## Prior to 2017

Prior to 2017 I led the [blue Systems Research Group](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/gwa/) at the University at Buffalo.
My [previous CV](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-CV.pdf) picks up where this one ends.
