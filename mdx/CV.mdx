## Appointments and Preparation

I am currently a [Teaching Associate Professor](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/challen) at the [University of Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (Fall 2017–present).
My appointment is 80% teaching and my focus is on teaching introductory computer science at scale.

At this particular moment in computing history, what we need is not more computer _power_—we need more computer _people_.
My goal is to create courses that excite, train, and retain these new computer scientists.
To reach as many students as possible, I focus on instructional approaches that can scale to large numbers of students while using only limited human resources.
I apply my own skills as a computer scientist to this task, by building novel tools and systems that create interactive and engaging learning environments, content, and assessments.

[My CS1 course](https://cs124.org) currently enrolls almost 2000 students per year.
Since I began teaching the course in Fall 2017, enrollment has doubled, drop rates have fallen, success rates have increased, student performance in downstream courses has improved, a previous gender performance gap has been eliminated, students are practicing and learning more, the amount of content covered has increased, and hundreds of staff members have made permanent contributions that help diversify the voice with which the course speaks.

### Previous Position

From 2011–2017 I worked in mobile systems as a research professor at the University of Buffalo.
My research group designed, built, and evaluated novel computer systems.
We focused on smartphones, since they represent the most pervasive and powerful distributed system ever deployed.
My [previous group's website](https://www.bluegroup.systems) is the best source of information about my prior research, and includes project descriptions, copies of all of our published papers and funded grant proposals, information about the courses that we taught, and details about former group members.

### Professional Preparation

* 2010–2011, Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Supervised by [Hari Balakrishnan](http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~hari/).
* 2010, Ph.D, Computer Science, Harvard University.
Dissertation: ["Data Fidelity and Resource Management for Data-Rich Sensor Networks"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.461.256).
Advised by [Matt Welsh](https://www.mdw.la/).
* 2003, AB, Physics, Harvard University.

* **Fall 2021–:** ["CS 124: Introduction to Computer Science I"](https://www.cs124.org) (University of Illinois)
* **Fall 2017–Summer 2021:** "CS 125: Introduction to Computer Science" (University of Illinois)
* **Fall 2016:** ["CS 199: How the Internet Works"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF-EPJcRpVWGzr-MwITe8AA) (University at Buffalo)
* **Spring 2011–Spring 2017:** ["CS 421: Introduction to Operating Systems"](https://ops-class.org/) (University at Buffalo)

### University at Buffalo (2011–2016)

During my five years at UB I taught a total of 1150 students—an average of 104 per semester—and offered four different courses to beginning undergraduates, advanced undergraduates and graduate students.
Despite being extremely challenging and required for undergraduate computer science majors, my [course on computer operating systems](https://ops-class.org/) was among the most popular in the department and a favorite of both graduate and undergraduate students.
My graduate seminar on rotating topics in mobile systems attracted a small group of motivated students and recruited sev-eral new Ph.D. students into my group, while giving advanced undergraduates the chance to explore research topics.
In Fall 2016 I introduced [a new course on the internet](https://www.bluegroup.systems/courses/ub_199_fall_2016/) to freshman undergraduates.

My [UB online teaching portfolio](https://www.bluegroup.systems/portfolio/) has information about these and other teaching- related activities at UB.
I also have copies of a [teaching statement](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-Teaching.pdf) and statements of [course effectiveness](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-Effectiveness.pdf) and [improvement](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-Improvement.pdf) that I prepared in 2016.

## Course Innovations

* **2021:** Created a series of [introductory Kotlin lessons](https://www.cs124.org/lessons/) to complement and eventually run side-by-side with our existing Java lessons
* **2020:** Developed a [new interactive walkthrough format](https://www.cs124.org/best/#walkthroughs) for deploying live coding explanations and soliciting [contributions from course staff](https://www.cs124.org/contributors/)
* **2020:** Created [a new online quiz system](https://www.cs124.org/best/#quiz-system) to support remote Zoom proctoring
* **2020:** Restructured CS 125 to support asynchronous instruction in a [daily interactive lesson format](https://www.cs124.org/best/#daily-lessons)
* **2020:** Designed and developed [a new framework](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/questioner) accelerating the development of [small Java programming problems](https://www.cs124.org/best/#homework)
* **2020:** Created an [efficient online help system](https://www.cs124.org/best/#help-site) to support students after CS 125 transitioned online
* **2019:** authored and deployed the first [multi-part Android programming project](https://cs125-old.cs.illinois.edu/MP/2019/fall/0/) for CS 125
* **2019:** deployed CS 125 on local cloud infrastructure providing enhanced scalability and robustness

## Curriculum Development

* **2020–2021:** Led a team of faculty that proposed and passed a significant revision to the core programming sequence at the University of Illinois.
The revision created several new courses and improved the accessibility of the computer science degree program for non-majors.
* **2016–2017:** Led the Curriculum Development Committee which proposed and passed a significant revision to the undergraduate curriculum at the University at Buffalo.
The revision created several new courses and updated several others to overall produce a more relevant and engaging undergraduate degree program.
* **2016:** designed and deployed "CS 199: How the Internet Works", a undergraduate course at the University at Buffalo.

## Service

* **2021:** Helped organize the inaugural [Illinois Computer Science Summer Teaching Workshop](https://teaching-workshop.cs.illinois.edu/2021).
* **2011–present:** Service on departmental committees including undergraduate studies, faculty hiring, diversity, curriculum revision, and others.

## Prior to 2017

Prior to 2017 I led the [blue Systems Research Group](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/gwa/) at the University at Buffalo.
My [CV there](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-CV.pdf) picks up where this one ends.
