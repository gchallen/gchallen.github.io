<div className="lead">

My professional goal is to teach computer science to as many people as possible, and to inspire them to use their skills to change the world for the better.

</div>

I'm a teaching faculty.
As a result, my curriculum vitæ—the ["course of my life"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae)—is focused around creating new content and tools to support my courses.
My CV focuses on these activities.

## Prior to 2017

Prior to 2017 I led the [blue Systems Research Group](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/gwa/) at the University at Buffalo.
My [CV there](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/challen@buffalo.edu/GeoffreyChallen-CV.pdf) picks up where this one ends.
