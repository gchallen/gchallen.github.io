**I write code that helps students learn.**

</div>

I create and maintain a variety of software tools to support my courses.
Most of my projects are published on GitHub, and many are publicly deployed and freely available for educators and students to use and extend.

## `learncs.online`: Learn to Program Online

[`learncs.online`](https://learncs.online) is the freely-available version of the materials developed to support [CS 124](https://www.cs124.org/)—my CS1 course at Illinois.

[`learncs.online`](https://learncs.online) provides public access to the same novel features that have helped make CS 124 so successful:

* [61 daily lessons](https://www.learncs.online/lessons) introducing programming and computer science concepts in both Java and Kotlin
* 902 runnable and editable [playground examples](https://www.learncs.online/best#playgrounds)
* 2,540 [interactive walkthroughs](https://www.learncs.online/best#interactive-walkthroughs) from [264 instructors](https://www.learncs.online/people)
* 132 [homework problems](https://www.learncs.online/best#homework) providing both correctness and [code quality feedback](https://www.learncs.online/best#code-quality)
* novel [debugging challenges](https://www.learncs.online/best#debugging-challenges) that help students learn to fix small mistakes

## Interactive Code Walkthroughs

One of the most distinctive features of the [`learncs.online`](https://learncs.online) and [CS 124](https://cs124.org) materials is their use of [_interactive walkthroughs_](https://www.learncs.online/best#interactive-walkthroughs).

This novel component combines the best features of recorded live coding—being able to watch exactly what the instructor is doing and listen to their explanation—while still maintaining the interactive features of a playground.
Because the interactive walkthrough is an animated editor and _not_ a video, students can pause at any point and edit or execute the code.

Interactive walkthroughs are also recorded _in-situ_ directly on the page where they are viewed, providing authors with awareness of how that explanation is used within the context of the surrounding information.
By lowering the barrier to providing this kind of content, we have been able to incorporate contributions [hundreds of CS 124 course staff](https://www.learncs.online/people), significantly diversifying the course's voice.

We are working on making this explanatory component more broadly available^[[EdStem Lessons](https://edstem.org/lessons) also has a similar feature in beta, if you'd prefer a commercial alternative.].
Stay tuned!

## Jeed: Speedy JVM Execution and Analysis

[Jeed](https://jeed.run) ([GitHub](https://github.com/cs124-illinois/jeed)) is the speedy JVM execution and analysis toolkit.

Jeed's primary purpose is to enable fast and safe execution of untrusted Java and Kotlin code.
It's what powers the Java and Kotlin playgrounds on this site, [`learncs.online`](https://www.learncs.online/best#playgrounds), and the CS 124 website.
It also powers our novel [homework autograder](https://www.learncs.online/best#homework) and [debugging question generation](https://www.learncs.online/best#debugging-challenges).
Jeed runs untrusted code in a secure JVM sandbox 1000 times faster than approaches that rely on containerization.
This huge performance boost makes it possible to support a large amount of interactive use using a small amount of server resources.
Jeed has been in production use since 2019.
