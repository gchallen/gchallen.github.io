Thank you for writing a letter on my behalf!
Below you'll find all of the materials I submitted for my application to the Associate Professor position in the [Sydney Horizon Educators](https://www.sydney.edu.au/about-us/careers-at-sydney/academic-careers/sydney-horizon-educators-opportunity.html) program at the [University of Sydney's](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html).
I'm interviewing there on 2/11/2026.

These are the materials I submitted: my [application letter (PDF)](/interviews/2026-02-11-university-of-sydney/Letter.pdf) and [curriculum vitae](/CV).

For the second stage of the interview, I created a video demonstrating the interactive walkthrough component I created to support student success in CS1.
It shows how these walkthroughs work within our daily lesson format, how they are recorded in-situ by instructors and course staff, and how they have helped diversify the voice of the course with contributions from hundreds of people.
The video also discusses opportunities to bring this innovation to the University of Sydney and expand it using AI.
A [video transcript](/interviews/2026-02-11-university-of-sydney/transcript.md) is also available.

## Other Materials

My [teaching statement](/teaching), [scholarship statement](/scholarship), [service statement](/service), and [project summaries](/projects).

## Combined

I've combined all relevant material into a [single file](/interviews/2026-02-11-university-of-sydney/Complete.md) for your convenience.
