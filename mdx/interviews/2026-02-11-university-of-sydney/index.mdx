For the second stage of the interview, I created a video demonstrating the interactive walkthrough component I created to support student success in CS1.
It shows how these walkthroughs work within our daily lesson format, how they are recorded in-situ by instructors and course staff, and how they have helped diversify the voice of the course with contributions from hundreds of people.
The video also discusses opportunities to bring this innovation to the University of Sydney and expand it using AI.
