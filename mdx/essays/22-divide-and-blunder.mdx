To continue our discussion of large courses, let's examine one key reason why they aren't better.

To recap [the first post in this series](/essays/2023-06-14-large-courses-should-be-better)—large courses _should_ be better.
They _need_ to be better, because most courses students take are large, even if most courses a university offers are small.
Large courses also tend to be both early and important, covering foundational knowledge that later courses rely on.
And large courses _can_ be better, by aggregating resources to develop excellent content and materials that support all students.

But large courses are not currently as great as they should be, and one of the primary culprits is small course mythology.
Many large courses fail to reach their full potential due to misguided efforts to make them seem smaller by spliting them into smaller pieces—an approach I call _divide and blunder_.

[Imagine](-) you've launched a technology startup.
You write and deploy some code.
That allows you to support a certain number of users.
But more users arrive, and your existing approach is no longer adequate to keep up with demand.
What do you do?

Here's what you _don't_ do: [You don't hire an entirely new set of developers to create and maintain a entirely new implementation of your software.](+)
That would be crazy!
Yes, you might hire more developers to help support more users.
You might eventually rewrite some of your code as needed to address scaling bottlenecks.
You might need to temporarily maintain two implementations during a transition.
But permanently maintaining two separate implementations both wastes human resources and creates consistency problems.

And yet, this divide and blunder technique is _precisely_ how many institutions deal with courses that get large: break them into multiple independent sections that may not share assessments, staff, systems, or even syllabi.
The only thing uniting such independent sections may be a single paragraph description in the course catalog.
Everything else is left to the discretion of the instructor running each section.
As we'll see, divide and blunder both fails to take advantage of advantages inherent to large courses while causing further problems negatively affecting students and the curriculum.

[Let's](-) start by examining an important implementation detail—the degree to which separate sections are functionally independent.
This has a big impact on the amount of damage done by the divide and blunder approach.

There are two things to consider.
First, how many separate sections are created?
Second, how independent are they from each other?
Let's use the example of a 1000-student course, and work from the better end of the divide and blunder spectrum to the worse.
This will also demonstrate how this kind of subdivision may happen—possibly making some amount of sense at first, but being increasingly hard to justify as we go.

[In](-) the beginning, we just needed more space.
Once courses get large, it can be hard to find a single room that fits everyone.
If the course is taught in a lecture format, this can be the initial trigger for the creation of separate sections.
So imagine we divide our 1000-student course into two 500-student sections, each taught by the same instructor, but with lectures in different rooms at different times.
This can also be helpful in making the course more available to students by reducing scheduling conflicts.
Everything else about the course is shared—the syllabus, assessments, staff, and so on.

At this end of the spectrum things are not _that_ bad.
Yes, you're wasting instructor time by presenting the same content twice.
Having done this myself, it can be hard to keep multiple lectures in sync, even when the same person is giving them.
Questions or corrections from students may not propagate, particularly from later lectures to earlier ones.
Useful discussions can cause one section to get behind relative to the others.
As anyone who has tried this knows, it's not unusual to have one section that asks _a lot_ more questions than others, probably due to students making each other comfortable interacting with the instructor.
And once the number of sections starts to grow, you also run into what I'll call the Groundhog Day effect: confusion about whether you’ve mentioned something in the current class created by the fact you said similar things an hour ago.
Good slides or notes are a big help here.

[But at this end of the spectrum, things are not that good either](+)—at least not if you're captive to small course mythology.
Two 500-student sections are still two large classes, which is one of the reasons that this initial division makes little sense if you can just find a 1000-student room.
Of course, there's an obvious way to continue in this direction: just divide the course into smaller and smaller sections.

[Here's](-) where we run into trouble.
Imagine we want to split this 1000-student course into 10 100-student sections—or even just 5 200-student sections.
We quickly reach the point where it's not feasible for a single instructor to provide all the lecture instruction.
For example, a typical lecture-based course at Illinois might have three hours of instruction per week that an instructor is expected to provide.
Two separate sections requires six hours—which is repetitive, but not terrible.
But five separate sections requires 15 hours, and ten requires _30 hours_.
Even the most attention-starved chalkface droner is probably not going to go for that, and that much repetitive presentation leaves scant time for all the other things an instructor is responsible for.

Inevitably, once we start subdividing large courses into smaller sections, we quickly reach the point where we need to add instructors.
And that has a high potential to cause trouble.
Because that's when academic freedom enters the chat.

[Let's imagine how this heads sideways.](+)
Alice has been teaching a course for a few years, but it's grown large enough that her department decides to assign Bob as a co-instructor.
Alice provides Bob with her slides, and Bob tries to adhere as closely as possible to Alice's content and delivery in his own sections.

Unfortunately, this is not what always happens—because there's often nothing guaranteeing Bob stays in sync with Alice, and lots of reasons they might diverge.
Maybe Alice provides Bob with her slides.
Or maybe she considers them her intellectual property and either refuses, or allows Bob to use them only accompanied by large and humiliating "Written by Alice" watermarks^[Even though she probably [cribbed them from somewhere...](https://harpers.org/archive/2007/02/the-ecstasy-of-influence/)].

Even if Alice does share her slides with Bob, Bob may not want to use them unmodified.
He may notice mistakes, or disagree with her approach to explaining certain things, or not understand certain examples, or prefer to sequence certain material differently, and so on.
If Alice is teaching faculty and Bob is research faculty, he may approach the task with an innate sense of superiority, armed with the knowledge that of course he can do better at the craft Alice has spent years perfecting.
Or maybe Bob just doesn't like Alice, and decides that’s a good enough reason to teach the material differently.
Who knows.

There's also a lot of university culture pushing Alice and Bob in separate directions, and little holding them together. 
Alice and Bob are both creative and innovative faculty, right?
Shouldn't they each develop their own approach to teaching the material?
Isn't this kind of independence what academic freedom is intended to protect?
(No.)
And if Alice (or Bob) decided to let Bob (or Alice) do all the classroom instruction while contributing to the course in other ways, wouldn't their student evaluations suffer?
Would students even know that they were teaching the course if they didn't see them lecturing from the front of the room?
In the face of these forces driving divergence, there's frequently nobody in a position to champion consistency.

Even if we _could_ get Alice and Bob to use identical slides, that alone doesn't ensure consistency of classroom instruction.
Because their verbal explanations will differ, and they'll move at different speeds at different points, and they'll answer questions differently, and they'll make different mistakes—all the same sources of variation as an individual instructor lecturing multiple times, compounded by the fact that multiple instructors don't share one brain.
And forcing instructors to adopt another person’s mental model may actually reduce their individual effectiveness, compared with allowing them to explain something in a way that makes more sense to them.

[Let’s acknowledge that we want instructors who want to make the course better](+), not ones content with the sinecure of coasting along using someone else's content.
So some of the impulses Bob is responding to are not necessarily bad, even if the changes need to be made collaboratively rather than independently to avoid causing consistency problems.

[When](-) what's taught in separate sections of “the same” course starts to diverge—when they go from separate to independent—this is the small hole that threatens to blow our entire consistency dam apart.
Because it all cascades from here.
Once the material starts to diverge, expect the assessments to follow.
And they really should, because assessments should align with how the material was taught.
At that point it’s likely that the course staff will also splinter, since staff from one section won’t be well-prepared to answer questions about material taught in another, or be aware of what's being tested and emphasized across the entire course.

Now we're well on our journey to the other end of the divide and blunder spectrum—where multiple sections of a single course are functionally independent, and share little except that one paragraph description in the catalog.
At that point we've abandoned most if not all of the benefits inherent to large courses, and are creating a knowledge consistency mess for later courses to deal with.

Just to give you a sense of how far you can go in this direction, let me share one real-world example.
I have heard of a large introductory computer science course that, in full thrall to small course mythology, is taught entirely in independent 40-student sections by dozens of non-cooperating instructors.
These sections are not required to share anything: not syllabi, not slides, not textbooks, not staff, not assessments—nothing.
Some sections require that students purchase expensive online textbooks, others don't, so even the cost to students varies.
Every instructor is freelancing, and new instructors are free to start from scratch.

[Splitting](-) large courses into smaller independent pieces suffers from both of the serious problems we identified in the software development analogy above.
The parallels may or may not be obvious, but let’s examine them to drive the point home.

Previously we noted that the resources generated by large courses support the creation of excellent materials.
A 15-week course with weekly assessments needs 15 assignments, regardless of enrollment.
A course with 1000 students should have 10 times the resources to create and maintain these assignments than a course with 100 students.
When independent sections maintain independent materials, divide and blunder has surrendered this key benefit of large courses.
The resulting materials are mediocre, stale, or both.

The resources generated by large courses also make it possible to recruit and retain excellent instructors.
But again, once divide and blunder starts requiring extra faculty, you’re both dividing the resources you need to support them and reducing their impact on the course.
Finding one or two excellent instructors for a large course is hard enough—even with the motivation of having impact at scale.
Finding five or ten who are equally competent and motivated is extremely unlikely.

The resources generated by a large course also make it possible to properly pay and title a few excellent people who can focus all their time and energy on the course and stick around for years.
But once you need many more teachers to create the illusion that the class is small, you're more likely to end up with inexperienced graduate students, poorly-paid adjuncts, or faculty busy with too many other things—and nobody who will stick around for long.

When you don't hire excellent faculty, you don’t get excellent materials.
And when independent sections don't share materials, even the better materials—assuming you can identify them—only reach a subset of students.
Put more bluntly: the independent sections created by divide and blunder have the potential to put random subsets of students in the hands of mediocre or even poor instructors using mediocre or even poor materials.
Rather than the alternative, where excellent instructors create materials that benefit all enrolled students.

[Equally](-) if not more damning are the consistency problems created by the divide and blunder approach.
Returning briefly to our software development analogy.
Imagine you're an external developer trying to use an API provided by our hypothetical technology startup.
Now imagine that every API call may be handled by one of several independent implementations chosen at random.
Now imagine that the only information shared between the independent development teams is a single paragraph describing how the API should work—no detailed documentation, no tests, nothing like that.
Now imagine trying to get anything useful done using that API.
Good luck!
I will pray for you.

And this example only hints at how damaging consistency problems created by divide and blunder can become.
Large courses are frequently at the beginning of long prerequisite chains.
[To make forward progress, downstream courses must be able to build on knowledge acquired in earlier classes.](+)
If one independent section doesn't cover a topic, or doesn't cover it well, then a later course will need to reteach that material—to _every_ student, even the ones that already know it.

Note that in this discussion I’m talking about accommodating students who "did well" in the previous course, not any student regardless of their previous performance.
But another facet of the consistency problems created by divide and blunder is that "did well" loses a clear meaning. 
For example: the course description says to cover recursion.
In one section the instructor waives their arms briefly over a few slides and includes one multiple-choice question on the exam.
In another section multiple weeks are spent on the topic with students given ample opportunities to demonstrate their understanding.
Two students took "the same" course.
Both earned a good grade.
But did they both learn recursion?

Depending on the degree of independence, divide and blunder has the potential to create significant knowledge disparities between students who took "the same" course.
In the worst case, downstream courses have to reteach large amounts of material that students have already paid to learn.
A bit of review is completely appropriate
But too much means that two courses are doing the curricular work of one, and essentially represents a hidden increase in the amount of tuition required to learn a certain subject.
A well-run follow-on course will also end up slowing to accommodate the least-prepared "successful" students arriving from an upstream prerequisite, meaning that a single poorly-taught independent section can ruin the entire batch.

I'd also suspect that consistency problems end up confusing and potentially demoralizing students.
Both students above _think_ they know recursion.
But once they need to apply that knowledge later, one is set up for success, the other for struggle.
And this may be a cue for the struggling student to think: "I'm just not good at this", rather than realizing that they just weren't taught that topic well.

[Perhaps](-) at this point you're hoping that there’s a silver lining here somewhere.
Couldn't multiple independent sections represent laboratories of education—experimenting with different approaches to determine which is the most effective?

In theory: maybe.
In practice: never.
There are just too many variables to control and, when multiple independent sections don’t share assessments, no way to evaluate the results.
As much as instructors might bristle at the idea of being forced to share assessments, that's really the only way to even start to figure out what's going on.

---

But even shared assessments may not be sufficient to overcome another significant confounder: registration. Given the choice between multiple independent sections, students who are able to register for either will make that choice based on all kinds of information: instructor reputation, feedback from other students, official or unofficial course reviews, the perceived difficulty of that section compared to others, the time the section meets at, and so on. Little to none of this information is directly related to how much they’ll actually learn in the course—which is understandable given that universities don’t bother measuring that somewhat-important piece of data, much less distribute the results to students. I’ve lost track of the number of times I’ve heard students ask which professor for a given course is easier. I can’t remember hearing a student ask which professor for a given course will teach them more effectively.

And this gets even worse, because the distribution of students between independent sections is also affected by registration priority. As anyone who has attended most universities recently knows, class registration ordering makes airline boarding look non-hierarchical. Students may have earlier or later access to certain courses for all kinds of more or less understandable reasons: how close they are to graduation, whether they are majoring in the subject, status in various honors programs, and so on.

I could and may pen an entire separate essay complaining about this registration ordering system, which isn’t designed to accomplish a coherent objective, much less achieving any. But for our purposes it suffices to say that the students who enroll in separate sections of the same course are nowhere close to a representative sample.

And registration priority can interact with differences between independent sections that make any kind of analysis even more difficult. As an example, assume that Alice has a reputation for having high but achievable standards for her students, while Bob covers less material and is a much more lenient grader. Also assume that the students who register earlier tend to be more well-prepared—which is a reasonable assumption given that they tend to be more senior and majoring in the subject.

Given typical student tendencies, it’s easy to imagine an outcome where most of the well-prepared students register for Bob’s section and the less-prepared for Alice’s. Maybe this sounds cynical, but my sense is that the majority of students today will take an easy A over the opportunity to truly learn the material at a “risk” to their GPA. You can imagine how student performance looks at the end of the term. So now, who’s the better instructor? Bob, who started with stronger students who “succeeded” because he demanded little of them? Or Alice, who started with weaker students who learned more because she challenged them?

Is it possible to tease out these kinds of differences to determine which section is more effective? With enough data and effort, of course. But this just isn’t being done today, at least not unless one section is doing something new and wants to write a research paper. And even if you could determine which section was more effective, pinpointing the reason why would be equally challenging, particularly when independent sections have diverged in multiple ways.

What happens today is simpler and sadder: independent sections are freely allowed to create significant consistency problems, which the next course in the sequence has to try to correct. Divide and blunder indeed.

Building better large courses means rejecting small-course mythology and embracing what can make large courses great—particularly the availability of resources to hire excellent instructors and the potential for the great materials they create to scale infinitely.

In the final installment of this series, I’ll provide suggestions about how to structure and staff large courses so that they not only should be great, but can be.
