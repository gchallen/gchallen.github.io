title: "Large Courses Should Be Better: Part 1"
description: >
  Large university courses must be better and can be better. But they also fail
  in predictable ways, negatively affecting large numbers of students.

[One](-) of the more frustrating unexamined assumptions about universities is the myth of small course superiority: That small courses are inherently better than large ones.

You hear echoes of this everywhere.
From universities themselves as they brag about "small class sizes" and "close contact with faculty".
From prospective students and their parents as they automatically identify large courses as a liability, to be placed firmly in the con category when comparing institutions.
From faculty themselves as they inherently assume that the quality of education will somehow inevitably decline as more students enroll in their course.
[The superiority of small courses is taken for granted](+), to the degree that it's implied that it’s the main thing that you pay for when you shell out extra for a expensive private college as opposed to a (slightly) less expensive public university.

I'll concede that, at today’s universities, large courses are not invariably better than small courses—although it's not clear that they are actually worse, or whether it's possible to perform a fair comparison.
But I also believe that large courses _should_ be better than smaller courses, for several of the multiple meanings of should—they _must_ be, they _can_ be, and they also aren't currently.

So let's examine all three of these claims.
In Part 1 we'll explain why large courses _must_ be better than small courses.
Simply because, at most universities, most courses taken by students are large, even if most courses offered by the university are small.
Meaning that the best way to improve university education is to improve large courses.
We'll also explore how large courses _can_ be better than small courses, as the resources generated by more students create the opportunity to improve components of the course that scale infinitely well.

To conclude, in Part 2 we'll examine multiple reasons why large courses aren't currently better than small courses—including institutional neglect, bad decision making, and ineffective course design.
Several of the common mistakes that cripple large courses are directly enabled by the myth of small course superiority.

The problem is that large courses have a disproportionate impact on the student experience because—well, they’re large! 
Here's the formula to calculate the average class size at a university: $\frac{\sum(C)}{|C|}$, where $C$ is the set of enrollments and $|C|$ is the size of $C$ or the total number of courses taught.

But here's the formula to calculate the average class size _experienced by a student_: $\frac{\sum(C^2)}{\sum(C)}$.
The squared term in the numerator is what reflects the outside impact of large courses on the student experience.
It's also what renders the statistics on class size flaunted by universities as bunk, and leaves many graduates wondering—what happened to all of the small classes I was supposed to take?
