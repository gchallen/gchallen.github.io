[After](-) months of hearing a lot of talk about generative AI, I finally
starting using it myself during the summer of 2025. I came to the party late and
with some reluctance. But I work at the intersection of two areas destined to be
fundamentally transformed by AI&mdash;technology and education&mdash;and I so I
decided I needed to see what all the excitement was about.

My first experiment was a brief foray using Cursor for a personal side project.
Looking back, I must have grasped enough of the technology's promise to make a
bigger investment, because the next thing I did was sign up for the $100 / month
Claude Code Max plan. But I still wasn't completely sold. When I forked over my
first benjamin in late June, I remember thinking: "I hope I get my money's
worth."

Three months later and I'm using Claude Code constantly&mdash;absolutely for all
of my coding tasks, but in many other ways as well. Coding with Claude has
enriched and improved my programming practice, and I'm continuing to find new
ways to leverage its capabilities. In my experience, collaborating with AI
agents more productive, more enjoyable, and creative than traditional
programming. This is definitely the future of programming, and I'm [adjusting my
CS1 course](https://www.cs124.org/ai) to ensure that my students are prepared
for that future.

At some point I'd like to explore the many ways that collaborating with AI leads
to a healthier coding practice: the conversational paradigm, the ability to
externalize mistakes, the opportunity to focus on design, and so on. But to
start, I'd like to just share some of how I've been using coding agents,
specifically Claude Code, to support my own programming practice.

This is at least in part to try to encourage other educators who have yet to
explore the capabilities generative AI to support their own work. I'm worried by
the number of CS educators I have spoken with who admit to having no first-hand
experience with these tools. This is the future! And while it's true that there
are legitimate concerns about the rise of AI and the impact it will have on
technology, education, and society, it's hard to have an useful conversation
about the pros and cons with someone who only understands the cons. Because
there are pros. There are definitely pros.

[For](-) the sake of organization, I've divided this list into four overlapping
categories: course stuff, ugly stuff, fun stuff, and personal stuff. I'll start
by discussing ways that I'm using AI to support my primary professional
activity: teaching [CS 124](https://www.cs124.org), the introductory computer
science course at the University of Illinois. I do a lot of software development
to support my course, but I know that not all educators do, so I'll include a
mix of both programming and non-programming tasks in the group, and of course
supporting a course also includes tasks that are both fun and ugly, so there's a
bit of both of those groups mixed in here too.

## Rolling Out And Reviewing CS 124 Lessons

Preparing CS 124 for each new semester involves a variety of tasks, as I work to
make sure our materials and infrastructure are ready for a new group of
students. Most tasks are specific to how our materials are maintained and
organized. For example, CS 124 teaches computer science through a series of
daily lessons, which students can complete in either Kotlin or Java. Each lesson
in stored in a single MDX file, MDX being Markdown with extensions allowing the
integration of interactive content.

I have chosen to store each semester's worth of lessons in a separate directory.
Some lessons we reuse essentially unaltered from semester to semester, but
others are rewritten more frequently. While different file organizations that
would make the task I'm about to describe easier are certainly possible,
maintaining per-semester directories is simple and has the benefit of preserving
lessons from previous semesters side-by-side in the same Git repository^[Yes, of
course, everything is checked in to Git; and yes, of course, you could use
tagging or other Git features to preserve previous semester content, but not
side-by-side.].

As a result, one of the first steps in rolling out a new semester is `cp -R
Spring2025 Fall2025`. Unfortunately, it's not quite that easy! Because each
lesson has metadata that includes the data, and a filename that indicates
position of the lesson within the semester to enable easy command line
navigation. For example, lesson `013_loops.mdx` is on the third day of the
second week of the course, and contains YAML front matter that includes `date:
2025-01-29`. All of this needs to be corrected each semester. Not only do the
dates change, but the position of holidays within the semester also changes,
which can cause lessons filenames to change.

Previously I would put on a good playlist and grit my teeth and spend the hour
or so it took to do this by hand. This fall I did it conversationally with
Claude. It was quickly able to understand the lesson file naming convention and
metadata, as well as the Illinois academic calendar, and quickly corrected all
dates and moved all files into the right place.

But Claude's ability to migrate lessons went beyond these fairly easy patterns.
Because the lessons also end up containing other temporary anchors that need to
be changed. Some of them are, like the date metadata, straightforward to
correct: fixing the links that point to the `Spring2025` syllabus to point to
the `Fall2025` syllabus. But others are more subtle. For example, an programming
example from an early lesson on variables with values indicating that it's hot
outside. Appropriate for the summer and fall terms, yes; not so much for the
spring session, when this lesson falls in late January. Claude spotted that. I
also sometimes add announcements to lessons---either from student groups, or
based on what's currently going on in the course. Claude spotted a few of those
as well.

Once I noticed Claude demonstrating a reasonable understanding of the lesson
content, I started using it to do more holistic review. Most of these lessons
date back to 2020 (Java) or 2021 (Kotlin), and have been reviewed by hundreds of
course staff and used by thousands of students. But Claude is still noticing
small typos, grammatical errors, and other mistakes. We could all use help
reviewing and improving our course materials^[I frequently encounter _very_
sloppy content when reviewing other course websites and assignments...], and
Claude is capable of this task.

Interestingly, I've also found Claude capable of comparing the Kotlin and Java
versions of our lessons and other course content to ensure alignment---we're
teaching the same concepts in either language. I'll return to its ability to
review course materials below.

## Migrating CS 124 Walkthrough Transcription from Otter to WhisperX

Early on I confined my use of Claude for coding tasks to new standalone
projects, unsure of how it would fare in my larger, older, and more
mission-critical repositories. For example, after a conversation with a
colleague that ended in a challenge, I let Claude work independently to create
[this interactive website demonstrating the Monty Hall
problem](https://demos.geoffreychallen.com/monty-hall-problem).

But as I gained confidence in its abilities I eventually decided to let it work
in my main CS 124 monorepo, which contains all the code supporting the main
websites and NodeJS microservices. (But not several important backend services
that are implemented in Kotlin and run on the JVM&mdash;these live in their own
repositories.) Around the same time I was using Claude to create several useful
deployment and cluster maintenance scripts: For example, one that ensures that
all microservice containers are running on our Kubernetes cluster at their
latest version. But I think that this was the first significant new courseware
feature that Claude and I worked on together.

One of the primary ways that CS 124 delivers instructional content is through
what we call _interactive walkthroughs_. These combine an animated Ace editor
with an audio voiceover. People sometime confuse the result for a video showing
someone programming&mdash;but it's not, because the code remains fully
interactive. Students can pause the explanation at any point and interact with
the code, modifying and running it to perform their own experiments.
Interactive walkthroughs also have the benefit of having significantly lower
bandwidth requirements than video, and also avoid the stupidity of taking data
in a useful format (code) and converting it to a much less useful format
(pixels) that also happens to take up a lot more space.

Each interactive walkthrough includes an audio track. And, for each audio track,
we generate a transcript. Transcripts are essential for students who have
trouble hearing, but they are also useful for other students, and I've always
considered it important to provide them. I'll admit I was also thinking forward
to implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for the CS 124 website, and
wanted the transcripts for that purpose as well.

Initially we did this using Otter.ai, which was recommended to use by our campus
accessibility group. This worked, but it had several drawbacks. Otter's "API"
involved moving files back and forth from a Dropbox folder, which was possible
to automate using `rclone` but ugly. And that "API" was also expensive, and
while Illinois would reimburse that cost, the paperwork and lead time involved
was annoying.

I had investigated options like AssemblyAI, which seems to improve on Otter in
terms of accuracy and _definitely_ has a better API. But what I really wanted to
try was Whisper. One of the peculiar things about developing courseware at
Illinois is that it's frequently easier to get machines that it is to get the
university to pay a small amount of money for an external service^[Yes, this is
stupid.]. I have ample compute to support CS 124, so the promise of performing
transcription on premises was appealing. Around this time I noticed an article
on WhisperX on Hacker News, and that's what reminded me to get started on this.

To support Claude completing this task I adopted the development pattern that
I've continued to use and refine when working with agentic AI in mature
codebases. First, I move the repository to a branch. Next, I write up an initial
specification describing the task that I want Claude to accomplish. Then I put
Claude into plan mode and have it produce a plan based on the specification.
Usually we iterate for a bit at this point. Initially I respond to its plan by
improving the specification, but eventually as the plan improves I begin
refining the details through chat interaction.

Once I'm reasonably happy with the plan I allow Claude to begin implementing the
requested functionality. Usually the plan includes some way to test its work
before deployment. For the WhisperX transcription support, I installed WhisperX
on my development machine, and the pre-deployment testing was done through a
standalone script that I had it develop to reprocess old audio files using
WhisperX. Running that script allowed me to gain confidence in its
implementation, while also doing a few spot checks along the way.

In my experience Claude works quickly and gets a lot right on the first pass.
And while it's not perfect, there's an excitement to having so much working so
quickly that draws me in to working with it to fix its mistakes and complete the
task. It's also great at getting tedious things right&mdash;like all of the
command-line arguments needed to run WhisperX, or the various `Dockerfile`
incantations needed to add it to the containerized interactive walkthrough
backend.

If my memory serves it took a few hours spread over a few days to go from no
familiarity with WhisperX to having it completely replace Otter to generate
transcripts for our interactive walkthroughs. And keep in mind that the
interface to the two tools is entirely different. No longer do we need to use
periodic `rclone` tasks to move audio and transcripts back and forth to Otter.
Once the WhisperX support was working and deployed, the final task I completed
on this branch was to have Claude remove all traces of Otter support. That felt
very satisfying.

Reflecting on how I used AI to help complete this task, two ways in which my AI
coding assistant was helpful stand out to me. As described above, Claude was
able to grok how to use and deploy WhisperX much faster than I could have. But
it was also allowed me to skip an important first step I would have had to
complete had I done the migration myself: Reviewing the current Otter-based
implementation. Yes, of course, that code was written by me. But I work across a
lot of different codebases, hadn't seen that code in a while, and certainly had
forgotten many important details I would have needed to reload into my brain had
I completed the WhisperX migration myself.

## Improving CS 124 Quizzes

I'm a strong believer in frequent small assessment. CS 124 was giving weekly
quizzes when I took over the class in 2017, and I've continued that practice
while also adding programming and debugging questions to the multiple-choice
questions students were completing previously. I've published work on our system
for rapidly authoring programming questions, and at this point our bank of
programming questions is large enough to support multiple programming questions
on each weekly quiz, multiple variants of each programming question to create
unique exams, _and_ provide students with plenty of practice programming
questions on a practice quiz they use for preparation. But we have far fewer
multiple choice questions, and an perennial student complaint has been that the
handful that are included on the practice quiz aren't adequate preparation for
the larger number they have to complete during their weekly assessment.

I know exactly what's preventing us from providing more practice multiple-choice
questions: Me! I don't like writing them! Creating more has been on my list of
things to do for several years, but it always gets pushed to the bottom by
improvements to the course that I consider more important&mdash;although it's
fair to wonder if some aren't simply things I consider more interesting. So once
I observed how effective Claude was at reviewing my CS 124 lessons during
pre-semester preparation, I figured I might as well explore how well it was able
to write new multiple-choice questions.

Initially I knew that I only wanted it to author multiple-choice questions for
our practice quizzes, to ensure that any broken questions that I failed to spot
wouldn't affect actual student assessment. I also quickly realized that I wanted
both a way to mark these questions as experimental, and a new reporting
mechanism allowing students and staff to report problems with them. That way
we'd warn students that these questions might have problems, and have a way to
identify ones that _don't_ have problems that might be candidates to rotate onto
graded assessments in the future. I was able to complete both of these new
features quickly through collaboration with Claude.

I currently use the following project-specific command to have Claude generate
new multiple-choice questions for practice quizzes. Note that it uses the graded
quiz as a model, creating a checklist of questions to either locate or generate
on the practice quiz. The "create a checklist" framework is one that I saw
recommended online as a way to keep Claude focused when working on longer tasks,
to avoid it declaring victory halfway through. I'm also careful to instruct it
to not create practice questions that are identical to questions from the graded
quiz, although a few mistakes here would not be the end of the world.

So far this seems to be working quite well. Student complaints about not having
enough practice multiple-choice questions are down. And while I have yet to
analyze the data generated by the reporting feature, students have brought
several bugged questions to my attention on our course forum. In each case,
given a bit of a hint, Claude was able to find a fix the question itself.

Which brings me to another meta-level observation about generative AI models.
In my experience they are generally very good at correcting their mistakes. At
first I thought this was because my corrections were providing additional
context that they were using in their debugging process&mdash;which is often the
case when providing error messages or descriptions of incorrect or missing
behavior. But I've realized that sometimes it's sufficient just to tell them
that something is wrong: "One of the practice multiple-choice questions on PQ4
contains a mistake."

You can draw clear comparisons with how we work with other humans. Sometimes the
right thing to do with a junior colleague&mdash;or one of your graduate
students&mdash;is just send them back to review their work with the instruction
to "think harder". But what might constitute a learning experience for a human
represents an annoyonce when working with AI. Why didn't you spot that mistake
the first time? It might have been important!

It's certainly possible that this is the result of the current agentic AI
pricing models, particularly the "all you can eat" pricing for agents like
Claude Code. The best thing for Anthropic is for Claude to declare victory as
quickly as possible to avoid consuming unnecessary resources. But in my
experience that often produces what seem like avoidable mistakes, particularly
when the agent could have spotted them by reviewing its own work. And it could
also be possible that this is due to fluctuating model quality or the stochastic
nature of AI itself.

My guess that is that we'll soon see better mechanisms for developers to
designate certain tasks as important to ensure that AI agents either spend more
time or use higher-quality models when working on them. My current workaround
here, which I sense is also used by other developers, is to manually drag Claude
back to certain tasks to review or doublecheck or critique its own work, with
the terminology fluctuating based on my mood or the time of day.

## RAG for CS 124 Course Content

[Claude](-) definitely shines for me when working on CS 124. But I've found it
invaluable for completing other types of tasks as well. To conclude, I'll
provide on example drawn from each of three categories: ugly stuff, fun stuff,
and personal stuff.

## Ugly Stuff: Handouts For My Reading Seminar

I suspect that many using Claude will agree with me when I say that generative
AI is _great_ at helping you do things that you don't want to do! Particularly
those terrible awful no-good very bad programming tasks that just have to be
done even though there's not an ounce of joy or glory in them. Web automation to
enter dozens of CS 124 staff appoinments? Done. Generating reports for our
meaningless ABET accreditation process? Done^[And done again when I realized I
needed a second variety of meaningless report.]. Creating a script to determine
the rate limits being applied to my Azure GPT endpoints? Done. Removing filler
words and creating paragraph breaks in a five-hour interview transcript? Done.
Several other awful coding tasks that, happily, I didn't have to work on long
enough to remember? Done, done, done!

For some ugly coding tasks, ugly is as ugly does: The output does the job but is
nothing to be proud of. But I'll describe this one in more detail because the
output is pretty nice, even if the code is definitely not.

In addition to CS 124, I also teach a small seminar on the intersection between
technology and society. Each week students complete a reading, discuss it in
pairs, and perform experiments to examine their own personal relationship with
technology. I assign selections from books on relevant topics, and do my best to
have students read some of the best writing from the best thinkers on these
topics. The entire reading list is available on the course website.

The class is small, and given our focus on device-free interaction, I prefer
students have access to paper copies of the readings. That means preparing PDFs
and then printing and copying them each week. The chapters are all from books that I
have purchased electronically. But in the past, extracting the selected chapters
from each eBook was a tedious manual process, and one that also produced
inconsistently-formatted output, despite my best efforts with Calibre.

My goal here was simple. Starting with a DRM-free eBook and list of chapters,
extract the chapter content in a way that would allow it to be printed with a
consistent format. My starting point for Claude was a single StackOverflow post
indicating that this was possible, and providing some general guidance on how to
accomplish it. I put Claude into vibe code mode and we worked one book at a
time. We'd get one to work, the next one would be a bit different, we'd make
some adjustments, and continue the process.

Did this take longer than I had wanted? Yes, it did, although to be fair, I
wanted it to take about five minutes. Were the results worth it? I think so.
After many iterations I now have beautifully-formatted handouts for every week
of the course that meet all of my original design requirements, using a
framework that makes it easy for me to add, remove, and reorder readings as
needed.

[As](-) with all of my prior Claude Code projects, this one provided new
opportunities for learning how to work with AI agents effectively and resulted
in new observations about their failure modalities.

For example, early on when working on this task we needed a way to convert HTML
documents to PDFs. Claude find a library that it wanted to use, but it quickly
became apparent that its chosen library did not support modern CSS styling,
resulting in illegible output. I suggested that we instead use Puppeteer, which
allows programmatic control of the Chrome web browser. This is a much heavier
solution, and starting an entire feature-complete web browser just to generate a
PDF from HTML might seem like overkill. But it does produce properly-formatted
output.

When working on another part of the project later and struggling again with HTML
to PDF conversion, it took me a minute to notice that Claude had _again_ decided
to use the broken HTML to PDF conversion library rather than the Puppeteer
approach. True, this was a different part of the project&mdash;formatting the
discussion questions I author as Markdown so that they could be combined with
the reading PDFs. But still, it was essentially the same task, and using the
same buggy library led to the same incorrect results. I'll admit that I may have
yelled at Claude a bit when I noticed this. Of course, it was quick to correct
its mistake.

This was also one of the first times that I noticed Claude going to
inappropriate lengths to complete a task as specified. At some point I had the
bright idea that, if I could just give it the Amazon product number, it could
extract the book title and author just from that information, reducing the
amount of data I would need to provide in the YAML file that laid out the books
and chapters assigned each week. I had assumed that either Amazon would provide
an API exposing this information, or that it could easily be web scraped from
their product listings.

Whoops! Apparently, not so much. Not only is there no API, but Claude quickly
hit rate limits when trying to web scrape the data. So, instead, I guess to
satisfy me, it hard-coded the data into one of the the scripts it was working
on. While this did in fact complete the task in the short term, since it could
now map a limited number of Amazon product IDs, obviously it completely missed
the point, which was to be able to look up this information when needed for new
readings. I eventually just decided to include the title and author information
in the YAML, and just have Claude double-check that for me. But it was good to
note that its eagerness to complete a task can result in an implementation that
entirely missed the mark. I'm wise to this behavior now, and have seen it a few
more times.

## Fun Stuff: KEXP Double Plays

## Personal Stuff: Claude As Ultimate Frisbee Coach

My final example falls squarely into the category of a personal project, and one
with only limited overlap with software development.
I've turned Claude into my personal ultimate frisbee coach!

I restarted playing ultimate frisbee in 2021 after a long hiatus. I was never a
serious player earlier in my life&mdash;I played on the B Team for Harvard's
club team Red Line for one semester, and might have attended one day of one
tournament with them. Maybe. Past that point it was just recreational, primarily
through intramural contents during undergraduate and graduate school. After we
moved to Buffalo in 2010 I forgot about the sport entirely.

Since I started playing again in 2020 I've been taking the sport and my own
fitness more seriously. This year I went to my first tournament in February, and
was even lucky enough to play at USAU Club Nationals in the Grand Masters age
division&mdash;which means I'm over fourty. If all goes according to plan I'll
have played in eight weekend tournaments in 2025 with several different teams,
as well as playing several times a week through local league and pickup games.
Returning to the sport has been incredibly beneficial to my physical and mental
health.
