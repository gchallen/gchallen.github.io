[When](-) the pandemic hit, we scrambled to create an effective approach to providing individual support online.
The process also led me to some insights about how to build community in CS1, and possible paths towards increasing diversity in our field.

Note that this is the second in a^[slowly moving] [series of essays](/essays/2022-04-08-my-cs1-backend) describing my course systems and infrastructure.

Also note that I had planned on publishing this years ago.
So at this point it also functions as a bit of a retro diary of the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a told someone recently, I essentially went into fight-or-flight emergency education mode in early 2020 and didn't come out for probably at least a year.
This was a tough period to live through, but it feels like enough time has passed to make it safe to revisit.

[It](-) was the week before spring break in March 2020 when I started to make adjustments to my class due to the pandemic.

We had two lectures scheduled that week.
Campus was still open, and students were still present.
Rather than continuing to pack 500 students in the second-largest lecture hall on campus, I decided to practice lecturing from my office using YouTube Live.
[When you teach a large course you're acutely aware of lectures as an effective disease vector](+), if not only because one of your jobs as the instructor is to avoid getting sick.
Also because you hear a lot of coughing.
And I figured that, if YouTube Live didn't work using the campus internet, it probably wouldn't work better from home.^[For the record, it worked quite well from both locations.]

Students left a few days later uncertain if they would return.
Some joker in campus administration decided to wait until several day into spring break to notify students that campus was closing and we would transition to virtual instruction for the remainder of the semester.
Which meant that many students had to return to campus to retrieve their belongings before returning home again.
Nothing like a bit of extra unnecessary travel during the onset of a global health crisis.

In fairness, there was a lot of difficult decision making going on around that time, accompanied by some fairly questionable messaging.
But it was clear to me and at least some of my colleagues which way things were headed.
Suzanna and I cancelled a planned spring break trip to Seattle to meet my new niece.
And so I suddenly had a free week to prepare for what promised to be an unusual half semester.
At minimum.
