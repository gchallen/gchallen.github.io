[I](-) teach [CS1](https://www.cs124.org) to thousands of students.
I also build and deploy lots of custom tools to support their learning.

Deploying these tools and services at scale requires a fair number of computational resources, and the challenges associated with managing them eventually led us to deploy our own private cloud.
How do we do this, and how did we get here?
I'm glad you asked!^[Well, maybe you didn't ask, but here we go anyway.]
It's been quite a journey.

## The Standard Package

[I](-) came to Illinois four years ago from a research faculty position in computer systems at the University at Buffalo, where I administered a smartphone testbed used by hundreds of local students and staff and taught a large course on computer operating systems.
As a systems faculty, I was used to having access to servers.
As a testbed administrator, I was used to maintaining backend systems.
And as an innovative educator, I was already using these abilties to create novel educational experiences for my operating systems students.

So when I arrived at Illinois and was assigned to co-teach a 800-student course, one of my first questions was naturally: Where are my servers?
I knew that [I was going to need machines.
_Lots of machines_.](+)

You might think that this would be the most natural request in the world.
A _computer_ science instructor needs some _computers_ to teach their large course on _computer_ science.
What was I going to do with these machines?
Computer science stuff!
Serve the course website.
Put up my Discourse course forum so that [I didn't have to inflict Piazza](/essays/2021-06-17-why-i-don't-use-piazza) on my students.
Run autograding jobs.
And who knows what else!
I'm a computer scientist.
I know how to create code that puts computers to work solving problems.
If I didn't, I'd be a pretty poor choice to teach students how to do the same thing.

So you'd understand how surprised I was to find that this kind of request was—and still is!—considered fairly unusual.
I was able to initially obtain what my IT staff referred to as the "standard package", a set of three fairly modest on-campus virtual machines.
I knew that these wouldn't be sufficient, but I got to work setting them up anyway.

Only to belatedly realize that they all had IP address in private ranges that were only routeable on campus.
Illinois uses the `172` private IP address range that was previously unfamiliar to me.
Still not sure why.
This also has caused conflicts with Docker.
Obtaining a public IP required several more roundtrips with local IT staff.
But two weeks into the semester we were finally able to set up the course forum so that students could access it from off campus.

There's a whole separate post coming discussing how poor IT departments are at supporting instructors who want to build innovative educational tools.
But that's not this point, and I promised to get to details of our current cloud setup.

## Machines. Lots of Machines.

[Clearly](-) I wrote this essay largely so that I could abuse that fantastic quote from the Matrix.
But it was clear to me fairly quickly that some of the things that I wanted to do were going to need more server power.

For example, previously live coding exercises in class had been done using pen and paper.
Don't get me started on the pedagogical flaws with this approach.
But at minimum my inability to write legibly made continuing this practice not an option.
I was able to quickly build out a server that could run Java code fast enough for interactive use—a predecessor of the [much more sophisticated and safer playground backend that is still in use in my class](https://www.cs124.org/best/#playgrounds).

But I needed somewhere to run it.
Since this was going to run during class and be used simultaneously by hundreds of students, load spikes were easy to anticipate.
And as anyone who has stood in front of a room of students knows, there is nothing more demoralizing than having technology fail during class.
Since a good chunk of class would be spent interacting with this Java playground, it going down would leave me dead in the water.

So I went back to my IT staff and, through some mixture of bribes and threats, was able to get them to spin up my first cluster of twelve machines, each with 4 cores and 4GB of RAM.
I containerized by Java playground backend, and used Docker Cloud to deploy it across the entire cluster of machines.
[It was Spring 2018 and I had created my first CS1 cloud.](+)

At that point the playground backend was the only thing running in my cloud.
Other components of the course backend—including autograding and grade delivery systems—were still deployed on individually-managed machines, usually using `pm2`.
But this was all about to change.
