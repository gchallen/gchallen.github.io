            <description><![CDATA[Recipe programming comprises working of a set of instructions to produce a program that achieves some desired outcome. While recipe programming is powerful and useful, it should not be confused with teaching the basics of programming, particularly when teaching introductory computer science courses.

            <description><![CDATA[With the pandemic seemingly drawing to a close, at least in the United States, it’s disappointing to see university students, administrators, and even instructors longing to return to outmoded and ineffective instructional methods. It’s not just a return to classrooms. It’s a return to lecturing, which we know doesn't work.

            <description><![CDATA[Piazza is not a forum. It doesn't build community, and it's design goals are oriented around enabling students to extract answers from course staff without engaging in the dialogue that builds understanding. If you are still using Piazza, please consider other much better alternatives.

            <description><![CDATA[Teaching large courses can have enormous impact. But it's easy for an instructor's effectiveness to decrease as the number of students grows. The trick is to avoiding this is to focus on the things that benefit all students—one for all—and avoid those that only benefit a few students—all for one.

            <description><![CDATA[Nothing has been more transformative for my CS1 course than frequent computerized assessments. Including programming questions on weekly proctored quizzes keeps students on track while also helping support many other unproctored assessments. Initially facilitated by an on-campus testing center, we've now successfully transitioned that component of the course online. I'll talk about how and why to use computerized assessments in CS1.
